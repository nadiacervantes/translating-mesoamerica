My son-in-law Tomas Francisco will not require or search for me again. But I have to give him, everything he did and corresponded to him. But if he wanted to [give and distribute] to my grandchildren and pay what he says and orders in the will. It really won’t be lost, and these are the ones who will testify. My witnesses and attorneys say here that they do not know the document.
