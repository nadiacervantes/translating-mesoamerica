<p>The commandments of our Lord God are ten:
The first three correspond to the glory of our Lord God and the other seven correspond to the help of our brothers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first one is, you will love God our Lord above all created things.</li>
  <li>The second one is, you will not make false promises in the holy name of God.</li>
  <li>The third one is, in worship you will have the day of observance.</li>
  <li>The fourth one is, you will honor and respect your father and mother.</li>
  <li>The fifth one is, no one will die by your hand.</li>
  <li>The sixth one is, you shall not be in lust.</li>
  <li>The seventh one is, you shall not steal.</li>
  <li>The eighth one is, you shall not raise falsehoods nor lies.</li>
  <li>The ninth one is, you will not covet what belongs to others.</li>
  <li>The tenth commandment is. Without a doubt and truly to carry out and love Our Lord God above all created things, love our neighbors as we love ourselves.
So be it, oh Jesus.</li>
</ul>
