<p>[4] San Juan Ixcoy, known as Yich Kʼox in Qʼanjobʼal, is a municipality of Huehuetenango, Guatemala. Other variations in spelling include Ixcoi, Ixcoy, and Iscox.</p>

<p>[5] San Miguel Acatán is located in Guatemala near Huehuetenango, distinguished from the Augustinian convent of San Miguel Acatlan in Hidalgo, México.</p>

<p>[6] The term quiquiztiliztli seems to be formed in reference to the quiquiztli or conch-shell trumpet (itself thought to derive from quiquici, to whistle). If so, the grammar reflects the idea that musical notation is the result of what is first played on a musical instrument.</p>
