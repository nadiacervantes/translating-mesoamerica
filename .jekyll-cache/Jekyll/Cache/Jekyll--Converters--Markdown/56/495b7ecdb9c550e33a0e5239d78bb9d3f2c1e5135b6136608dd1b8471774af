I"–<h2>Breve Tratado de Doctrina Christiana</h2>
<p>
    Doctrinas or catechisms were religious texts used by Spanish missionaries
    across the empire to educate natives on Christian culture, practice, and
    tradition. The purpose of a Doctrina Christiana in the New World was to
    prescribe specific interpretations of Catholicism tailored to different
    colonial audiences in Indigenous languages. These texts aimed to instruct
    individuals in the fundamental tenets of the faith and guide religious
    practice, such as teaching prominent prayers like the Our Father or Hail
    Mary or important Catholic teachings and stories from the Bible as part of
    the missionary orders‚Äô project to convert all the peoples of the Spanish
    Empire to Catholicism. Although the realities in the Americas were
    different, one can find the main precursors of catechisms in the New World
    in the christianization process and conversion policies of Jews and Muslims
    during the fifteenth and sixteenth century in the Iberian Peninsula,
    (Granicka 2023, p.4)
</p>

    Doctrinas were not isolated to just the Mesoamerican region but across the
    Spanish Empire in many Indigenous languages. In colonial Mexico, Spanish
    friars, collaborating with Indigenous peoples, produced a wealth of
    religious texts in native languages, like Nahuatl. The first doctrinas were
    produced very early in the colonial period and by the 1540‚Äôs there were
    already printed catechisms in Nahuatl. These texts served as essential tools
    for spreading religion, providing both teachers and Indigenous pupils with
    translations of Catholic doctrine accessible in the native languages of New
    Spain. This approach sought to bridge cultural and linguistic barriers to
    evangelization. For Spanish missionaries, the translations of Christian
    principles in Nahuatl allowed for a more effective and culturally relevant
    presentation of Catholicism, tailored to the specific context of colonial
    Mesoamerica where Nahuatl served as the lingua franca of the region before
    and after the Spanish conquest. However, the translation process did not
    come without its challenges and unintended consequences, as the
    pre-columbian religious terms permeated and influenced Christian discourse.
    Thus, the doctrinas became a medium that allowed the old Nahua concepts to
    survive in the language (Granicka 2023, p.11).

    The author of this Breve Tratado de Doctrina Christiana is an anonymous
    Franciscan friar, indicated by the initials "Fr. N [ ] de la R. Observancia
    de N.S.P.S. Francisco" in the first page of the document. The author wrote
    the Doctrina in 1774 in Taxco and was stationed at the ‚ÄúConvent of Saint
    Bernardino‚Äù during that time period. Indigenous participation in the
    creation of this text is possible, but as it was officially forbidden, it is
    only traceable through an analysis of the language used.

    Taxco‚Äôs significance lies in its role as a major hub for silver mining
    during the colonial
</p>
<p>
    period. Although it is not completely clear the extent of it, the reales and
    mines in this region used Taxco‚Äôs indigenous forced labor and brought
    Indigenous involuntary tribute from communities in Cuernavaca, Mexico City,
    Tlaxcala, Oaxaca, and other places (Haskett 1991, p. 452). In 1774, in
    colonial Mexico, when the Breve Tratado de Doctrina Christiana was written,
    the region was under the rule of King Charles III of Spain, a Bourbon
    monarch preoccupied with strengthening Spain's control over its colonies and
    reducing the threat of English dominance in the colonial economy. Part of
    his strategy was to maximize the mineral, agricultural, and financial
    resources of New Spain that ended up in a decapitalization of Spain‚Äôs main
    colony (p. Stein and Stein 2003, p. 352-353). Therefore, colonial Mexico
    experienced social and economic transformations driven by the exploitation
    of natural resources, particularly silver mining, an industry that fueled
    economic growth but also led to the exploitation of indigenous labor and
    social upheaval (Haskett 1991, p.474-475).

    The production of religious texts like this doctrina likely played a role in
    justifying and perpetuating the hierarchical social order established by
    Spanish colonizers, reinforcing their authority over the native population.
    But at the same time, the process of  translation of Christian beliefs into
    Nahuatl allowed for the Nahua worldview and religious concepts to permeate
    Christian discourse, creating spaces of ambiguity and contestation (Granicka
    2023, p.1).

    The Breve Tratado de Doctrina Cristiana was acquired in December of 1834 by
    an individual named Miguel, as noted on the inner cover of the manuscript, making him the
    first known owner of the book. Subsequently, in 1930, ownership was
    transferred to Robert Garrett, whose ownership mark is inscribed in pen on
    the back of the manuscript as "R. G. Mexico. 1930". Robert Garrett, a
    third-generation Princeton alumnus and member of the class of 1897,
    ultimately donated the Doctrina to the Princeton manuscript collection in
    1949 .
