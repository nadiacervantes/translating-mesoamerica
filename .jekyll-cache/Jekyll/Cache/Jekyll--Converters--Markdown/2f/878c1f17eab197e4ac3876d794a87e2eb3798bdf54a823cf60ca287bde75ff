I"Ã<p>Jes√∫s Mar√≠a and Jos√©, April 11, 1815.
With the license and power of our Lord God and our great ruler The King may he enjoy good health in his kingdom. Let those who will see and my brothers know that _____. We agreed to this agreement called Deed of Actual Sale of Land.
And the buyer of the land is called Juan Mat√≠as.
I live here in San Andr√©s Ahuazhuatepec and we belong to the government and head of Tizatlan. And before this agreement my mother Juana Florencia and my father Juan Diego Sano had, we live in Se√±or San Andr√©s and our neighborhood is  Xolotlah. And as a buyer, my name is Pedro de Santiago and my wife is called Mar√≠a del Carmen. I also live in San Andr√©s and my neighborhood is Xolotlah. And for the price of this land, I receive seven pesos ‚Äúlegally and in front of God‚Äù with this my heart calms and if the price were more, in this way I pray for grace and donation. The boundary begins in the west and the main boundary goes down and has nineteen arms and one and a half yards. The second wall that is below the main wall is twenty-three arm lengths and half a yard. The third wall that goes up towards the main wall has fifteen arm lengths ‚Äúand three counts‚Äù. The fourth wall that goes up the buyer‚Äôs wall has sixteen arm lengths and there the four walls close.
May they forever take care of it. The buyers are called Pedro and Santiago, Mar√≠a del Carmen‚Äôs husband. No one will take them away or deceive you because I ordered it so.
Up to this point, I, Juan Mat√≠as, husband of Mar√≠a Victoriana, are in charge. No one will look for anything or upset things. Whoever wants to repeal my deed will have to pay ten pesos, and I ask the S.M. May he always help and favor my possession and justice of the Republic. They will attest by putting their name and signature here. My witness is the buyer.
