[1] This abbreviation may indicate “honorable” (honorable) or “habitante” (inhabitant).
 
[2] This abbreviation for “maestro” indicates that Tomás Pascual served as maestro de capilla.

[3] Karttunen (1992:52) identifies chinamitl as “a term of social organization referring to a unit closely equivalent to a calpolli.”

[4] San Juan Ixcoy, known as Yich Kʼox in Qʼanjobʼal, is a municipality of Huehuetenango, Guatemala. Other variations in spelling include Ixcoi, Ixcoy, and Iscox.
	
[5] San Miguel Acatán is located in Guatemala near Huehuetenango, distinguished from the Augustinian convent of San Miguel Acatlan in Hidalgo, México.

[6] The term quiquiztiliztli seems to be formed in reference to the quiquiztli or conch-shell trumpet (itself thought to derive from quiquici, to whistle). If so, the grammar reflects the idea that musical notation is the result of what is first played on a musical instrument.
