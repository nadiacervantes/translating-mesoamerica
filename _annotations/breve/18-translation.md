The commandments of our Lord God are ten:
The first three correspond to the glory of our Lord God and the other seven correspond to the help of our brothers.


* The first one is, you will love God our Lord above all created things.
* The second one is, you will not make false promises in the holy name of God.
* The third one is, in worship you will have the day of observance.
* The fourth one is, you will honor and respect your father and mother.
* The fifth one is, no one will die by your hand.
* The sixth one is, you shall not be in lust.
* The seventh one is, you shall not steal.
* The eighth one is, you shall not raise falsehoods nor lies.
* The ninth one is, you will not covet what belongs to others.
* The tenth commandment is. Without a doubt and truly to carry out and love Our Lord God above all created things, love our neighbors as we love ourselves.
So be it, oh Jesus.
